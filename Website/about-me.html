                        My passion for design came from my artistic youth. 
                        I've always drawn, captured and inspired the world around me. 
                        My favorite mediums to use are my iPad and camera. 
                        When it comes to Adobe programs I'm most experienced in Photoshop and Illustrator. 
                        I spend a lot of time browsing and creating things on sites like Instagram and Deviantart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I specialize in illustration and graphic design. 
                        I love creating a logo and house style around an existing campaign or event idea! 
                        I get inspired by new trends like handmade illustrations, moving objects in art and experimental AI art.
                    </p>

                        At the moment I'm starting my study at HvA, here i follow Communication and Multimedia design. 
                        I also did Mediavormgeving at ROCvAF in 2020-2023.

                        People around me describe me as an artistic, kind & caring person with a lot of creative input. 
                        I always have creative and innovative ideas to bring to the table.
